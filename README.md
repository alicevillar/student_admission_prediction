# Simple Logistic Regression: predicting student admissions rate

Logistic regression, also called a logit model, is used to model dichotomous outcome variables.  
The purpose of this project is to discuss the prediction of student admission to graduate school using logistic regression.

## Problem statement

A researcher is interested in how variables, such as GRE (Graduate Record Exam scores), GPA (grade point average) and prestige of the undergraduate institution,
effect admission into graduate school. The response variable, admit/donâ€™t admit, is a binary variable.


This repo contains the dataset required for this tutorial, the Jupyter notebook, as well as HTML and Python code for this exercise.

The repository contains a loan eligibility prediction based on a [Kaggle dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alicevillar/loan-eligibility-prediction/blob/main/loan_prediction.ipynb). 
The primary goal of this project was to use Decision Tree and Support Vector Machines for predicting loan approval.  

### Quick Start  
[Check out](          ) a static version of the notebook with Jupyter NBViewer from the comfort of your web browser.


## Dependencies 
 
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Approach 

This project is organized in three parts:


* PART 1: Data Handling -> Importing Data with Pandas, Cleaning Data, Data description.  
* PART 2: Data Analysis -> Supervised Machine Learning Technique: + Simple Logistic Regression
* PART 3: Valuation of the Analysis -> Performance measurement + K-folds cross validation to evaluate results locally.
