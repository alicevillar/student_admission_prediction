The purpose of this project is to discuss the prediction of student admission to graduate school using logistic regression.

## Problem statement

A researcher is interested in how variables, such as GRE (Graduate Record Exam scores), GPA (grade point average) and prestige of the undergraduate institution,
effect admission into graduate school. The response variable, admit/donâ€™t admit, is a binary variable.
